# AZ104 Certification Tips
I recently took AZ104 and passed, I invested 8 months of my off-time and discovered the following resources helped the most during my studies, and it may help you to

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft provides an in depth course for AZ104 that is the perfect place to start when trying to get this certification, [Start here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104).

As I progressed through the course I used Quizlet to take notes on key topics and terms to help commit the info to memory.

## Quizlet

I used Quizlet to commit the info to memory, you can find my flashcards [here](https://quizlet.com/bRad1300/folders/az-104/sets).

## John Savill's videos

John Savill is a great instructor and has a youtube channel filled with certification crams and courses. You can find a lecture for the whole AZ104 course [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGlGPWs9xaLKT1KfwqREHbs).

The best help for pre test jitters was to watch his [AZ104 Cram Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOod_VNgdJk) and take thorough notes. You can find the notes I took [here](https://github.com/BradleyRayTroxel/BradleyRayTroxel/blob/main/AZ104/JohnSavillCramNotes.md).

## Udemy Practice Testing

A vital resource for this cert is taking practice tests to understand how the questions are asked and the reasoning behind the answers. I was recommended [Practice Tests | AZ-104: Azure Administrator Exam 2022](https://www.udemy.com/share/105EsG3@GHbHyWmOrcDnxIXgcW7QvhvvD4dl8Aw5LaujVVYIXQ3dZXYnfwp1hSstatYPY_6J-Q==/). Its a great product and lets you practice on a massive amount of questions to get ready for the exam. I worked to get 100% on each of the tests before scheduling the exam

## A Cloud Guru

I have not used this resource myself but have learned their website offers a azure cloud environment to build, burn, and break without fear of being charged by microsoft. [Head to the website here](https://acloudguru.com/). Its a steep investment at $348, but could be easier to justify at a $35 a month.
